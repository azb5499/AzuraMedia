# Azura media project

This application is a simple data capture and data output program. This is a web based system using Node.js and html with a simple Relational database backing up the system. We capture car information and then save it to a database. There are many conditions that the information needs to be saved in but thats simple to deal with.

## Note to those reading

Myself, the developer of this project has not had much experience in javascript due to using Razor and Jinja more often. Mainly jinja so there is a slight learning curve. But no worries, if my marks from my prior education have anything to prove. Learning is not the issue. I'll learn and apply what I learnt to demonstrate this application.

One final note. Due to AI being so prevelant and cheating in tests and assessments being so rife. I will be doing a full developmental breakdown. This will be done so any assessor can easily tell how this project was developed and know to some extent that AI was not used. And even if it was used, it will be described fully how in the documentation. 

The documentation will be in a markdown file called [devNotes.md](planning\devNotes.md),this link works if you download this project!. Further information about the development of this project will be located there. Lets keep the README file nice and tidyðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤£.

## Packages used.

## Reflection.

When I first received this project, I was daunted by the task. Although I had some familiarity with JavaScript, I knew I had to improve my skills quickly. With only six days to complete the project, I dedicated myself to learning and implementing JavaScript on the backend.

This project was an invaluable learning experience. I gained hands-on knowledge of using JavaScript to communicate with the frontend and build a full-scale web application. I applied various programming principles, such as the Open-Closed Principle, Single Responsibility Principle, and other design patterns.

I encountered some challenges, particularly with file imports and function execution in JavaScript. Additionally, database issues arose, but I was able to overcome them. Despite these obstacles, the overall experience was rewarding.

Sharing my progress with friends was a highlight, as we were all exploring new concepts in JavaScript together. Working on this project after work each day, with limited time on weekends, made the experience even more satisfying.

I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work on this project. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that helped me grow as a developer.
