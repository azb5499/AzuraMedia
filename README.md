# Azura media project

This application is a simple data capture and data output program. This is a web based system using Node.js and html with a simple Relational database backing up the system. We capture car information and then save it to a database. There are many conditions that the information needs to be saved in but thats simple to deal with.

## Note to those reading

Myself, the developer of this project has not had much experience in javascript due to using Razor and Jinja more often. Mainly jinja so there is a slight learning curve. But no worries, if my marks from my prior education have anything to prove. Learning is not the issue. I'll learn and apply what I learnt to demonstrate this application.

One final note. Due to AI being so prevelant and cheating in tests and assessments being so rife. I will be doing a full developmental breakdown. This will be done so any assessor can easily tell how this project was developed and know to some extent that AI was not used. And even if it was used, it will be described fully how in the documentation. 

The documentation will be in a markdown file called [devNotes.md](planning\devNotes.md). Further information about the development of this project will be located there. Lets keep the README file nice and tidyðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤£.
